The tools the human can use are:\\n\\nsearch: a search engine. useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. input should be a search query.\\ncalculator: Useful for getting the result of a math expression. The input to this tool should be a valid mathematical expression that could be executed by a simple calculator.\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS\\n----------------------------\\n\\nOutput a JSON markdown code snippet containing a valid JSON object in one of two formats:\\n\\n**Option 1:**\\nUse this if you want the human to use a tool.\\nMarkdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"action\\\": string, // The action to take. Must be one of [search, calculator]\\n    \\\"action_input\\\": string // The input to the action.
